# F1 Qualifying Predictor (R Version)

This project uses an R script to simulate and predict second stint lap times in Formula 1 qualifying sessions, based on:
- Driver
- Session (Q1, Q2, Q3)
- Circuit
- Weather (Dry/Wet)
- Tyre condition (New/Used)
- First stint time

### How it works
- The model simulates 300 laps using realistic parameters
- It uses linear regression to predict the second stint time
- You can customize it for real-time inputs or full-race simulations

### Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the `f1_qualifying_predictor.R` script in RStudio or your preferred R environment
3. Run the script to see the simulation and predictions

### Example Prediction

The script includes an example with:
- Hamilton (Q1, Dry, Monaco, New Tyres)
- Albon (Q1, Wet, Silverstone, Used Tyres)
- Alonso (Q3, Dry, Spa, Used Tyres)
